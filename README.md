# Book-Search-Engine-Mern

## Description

The MERN Book Search Engine is a web application that allows users to search for books using the Google Books API and save their favorite books to their personal list. The application is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and has been refactored to use a GraphQL API with Apollo Server, replacing the previous RESTful API implementation.
